# MyDyno

In my latest Unity game, I mentioned that it would be the last remake, but that turned out to be only partially true. Now, I'm embarking on creating my own version of the well-known Chrome Dino Game. However, this time, I aim to leave my own mark on it. I've designed my own sprites, implemented different mechanics, and introduced my own dynamic to the game.

Moreover, I'm striving to adopt a more professional approach, especially as I am actively seeking an internship. Alongside this repository, I will be documenting my progress using this [ClickUp Kanban board.](https://sharing.clickup.com/12930081/b/6-900304091953-2/quadro)

I anticipate learning a great deal and am eager to see the final results of this game infused with my own unique touches.

Thank you in advance for your support and feedback.

## Updates
It's been quite a while; I had some trouble balancing college with these personal projects. I decided to leave the game as it is. The functional part is finished, just needing some polish in UX/UI aspects that I will mention below.

I need to develop more games and explore different projects. I'll probably focus on minor projects to exercise more specific skills.

It was such a mess that I totally forgot about the Kanban board, but all these issues will receive more attention in future projects.

## What's Left to Do
- UX/UI Elements:
  - Create the Main Menu.
  - Polish the Game Over and Pause Canvas.
- Add an Animation to the Game Over:
  - I want the Dinosaur to fall when hitting the objects, like this [one](https://www.jogos360.com.br/pixel_dino_run.html).
  - After the fall, I was thinking of adding an image in the Game Over Canvas, showing an oil barrel, insinuating that this was the Dyno's destiny.
- Record the High Score:
  - This is something I know how to do, but it would require some changes in the UI that I wanted to avoid/decided was too much work for now.
- Game Introduction:
  - Unfortunately, the main idea of the game, the reason I decided to create it, wasn't implemented. I've learned that every game has a story, a reason for the player to play it. In my game, the Dyno was running desperately, crying, because a huge meteor was about to crash into the earth. I would love to add an animation where Dyno is drinking some water in a lake, then he's interrupted by this monstrous vision and starts running.

## Overall
I'm somewhat disappointed by how long it took me to complete this project. I need to work on my workflow, but considering I did all the work—sprites, animations, idea, UI/UX—it's still progress.

## Final Thoughts
This project has been a significant learning experience, despite the challenges and delays. Moving forward, I aim to refine my workflow and manage my time better, balancing academic responsibilities with personal projects. I’m excited about the journey ahead and look forward to applying these lessons to future projects. Your support and feedback are invaluable, and I appreciate every bit of it as I continue to grow as a game developer.
