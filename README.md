# MyDyno

In my latest Unity game, I mentioned that it would be the last remake, but that turned out to be only partially true. Now, I'm embarking on creating my own version of the well-known Chrome Dino Game. However, this time, I aim to leave my own mark on it. I've designed my own sprites, implemented different mechanics, and introduced my own dynamic to the game.

Moreover, I'm striving to adopt a more professional approach, especially as I am actively seeking an internship. Alongside this repository, I will be documenting my progress using this [ClickUp Kanban board.](https://sharing.clickup.com/12930081/b/6-900304091953-2/quadro)

I anticipate learning a great deal and am eager to see the final results of this game infused with my own unique touches.

Thank you in advance for your support and feedback.
